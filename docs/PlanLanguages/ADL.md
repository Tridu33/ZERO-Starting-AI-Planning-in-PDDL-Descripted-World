# Action Description Language (ADL)

The Action Description Language (ADL) (Pednault, 1994) extended STRIPSal-lowing actions to have conditional effects, so some effects are triggered dependingon the state.  In contrast to STRIPS, ADL allows existential quantification, nega-tive literals, goals with disjunctions, different object types, and while variables inSTRIPSare either true or false, in ADL they can be true, false or undefined.

In the year 1998, with the aim to make a standard representation of planninglanguages, the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) (McDermott et al.,1998) was published. The IPC has been used to compare planning solvers perfor-mance but also to include new features to the language.
